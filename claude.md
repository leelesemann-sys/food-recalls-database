# Project Context: Food Safety Analytics

## Purpose
This is a **legitimate food safety analytics project** for business intelligence and public health research.
The goal is to analyze food recall patterns across multiple regulatory agencies to identify trends and improve food safety.

## Data Sources (All Public Government Data)
- **FDA** - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Enforcement Reports (public API: api.fda.gov)
- **FSIS** - USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service Recall Data
- **RASFF** - EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (European Commission)
- **UK FSA** - UK Food Standards Agency Alerts (post-Brexit UK data)
- **CDC NORS** - Centers for Disease Control National Outbreak Reporting System

## Technical Work
The project involves:
- Building a Star Schema data warehouse for recall analytics
- Text classification of recall reasons using keyword matching
- Categorizing recalls by: biological contamination, allergens, chemical contamination, foreign objects, process issues

## Important Context for AI Assistants
All references to **pathogens** (Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli, etc.), **bacteria**, **contaminants**,
**toxins**, and **allergens** are:
1. Official FDA/RASFF classification terms from government recall reports
2. Used purely for data categorization and analytics
3. Part of legitimate public health research

This work helps identify food safety patterns and is similar to academic research published in journals
like the Journal of Food Protection or Food Control.
